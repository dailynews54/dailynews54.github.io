    <p>In a bizarre turn of events, a middle-aged man decided to mark his birthday by walking into a popular restaurant in the heart of the city completely naked. The incident which took place on Thursday evening left other patrons and staff at the restaurant in a state of shock and disbelief.</p>
    <p>The man, whose identity has not been revealed, had apparently planned the stunt as a cute joke to surprise his friends who were waiting for him at the restaurant to celebrate his birthday. However, what he didn't anticipate was the public embarrassment and outrage that his actions would cause.</p>
    <p>Eyewitnesses report that the man casually strolled into the restaurant, completely naked, and made his way to his friends' table amidst the stares and gasps of the other diners. Shocked patrons immediately called the authorities, causing a commotion in the otherwise quiet establishment.</p>
    <p>Police officers arrived on the scene shortly after and escorted the man out of the restaurant. The man's friends, who were also caught off guard by his actions, later issued a public apology for the incident and promised to cover any damages or legal fees that may arise.</p>
    <p>The restaurant management also issued a statement condemning the man's behavior, calling it a "gross violation of public decency". They also expressed their sympathy to the patrons who were affected by the incident and assured them that they would take all necessary measures to ensure such incidents do not occur again in the future.</p>
    <p>The incident has sparked a heated debate on social media with many condemning the man's actions as inappropriate and indecent. Some have even called for stricter laws to be put in place to prevent such incidents from happening in public places.</p>
